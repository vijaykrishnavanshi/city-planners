# City Planners
A menifesto to get architechts from around the world to collaborate on open sourced cities

## What?

Idea here is to create a community of architechts and planners to help build cities around the world. And people can get their design for current city reviewed and improved upon. 

## Why?

I think many cities in the world are poorely designed / architected. This community can be used to bounce off ideas of what could be done around them.

## How?

This will be volunteer driven organisation mainly. All the individuals are free not to engage in this activity. 

## Team

Every great initiative needs people that are aligned in terms of motivation. So this will be list of all the people that have or are contributing this project. (Sorted alphabetically)
